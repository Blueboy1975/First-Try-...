To use .CSS to put Border around Parent Container, Enable Flexbox, 
Wrap the contents (so they stay the size you coded and naturally move underneath each other) 
and Center the contents of the Parent \Container ...


.flex {
    border: 5px solid black;
    display: flex;                     Start/End 
    flex-wrap: wrap;                 Left  /  Right .... of page
    justify-content: center; OR flex-start; OR flex-end;
    padding: 50px;                                 This will help you to move elements around inside 
                                                   the PARENT CONTAINER, If you wanted to move them down
                                                   so they are even for example.     
} 

justify-content: space-between; ... Space the elements out.
justify-content: space-around;  ... Space elements symetrically.

flex-direction: row-reverse;    ... Reverses the order of the elements in the row.
flex-direction: column-reverse; ... Will display elements in reverse and down the page.

align-items:        flex-start; ... Items align to te TOP of the container.
                    flex-end;   ... Item align to the BOTTOM of the container.
                    center;     ... Items align to the CENTER of the container.
                    baseline;   ... Items dispay at the BASELINE of the container.
                    stretch;    ... Items are STRETCHED to fit the container.


Use a combination like this to move elements around ... Justify-content=middle of the itmes row it sits on.
                                                    ... Align-items=Up and Down the page.

justify-content: centre;
align-items: center;
